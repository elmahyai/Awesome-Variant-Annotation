## [Sudmant, P., Rausch, T., Gardner, E. et al. An integrated map of structural variation in 2,504 human genomes. Nature 526, 75â€“81 (2015).]( https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15394)

The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project was to find most genetic variants with frequencies of at least 1% in the populations studied. It was the first project to sequence the genomes of a large number of people, to provide a comprehensive resource on human genetic variation. Data from the 1000 Genomes Project was quickly made available to the worldwide scientific community through freely accessible public databases.
